# Notes #
Navbar is going to be uniform across the entire site. This will be added to both the blog page and\n
the events page. The blog page includes blog posts and testimonials side by side. This is because we\n
didn't feel that they both needed separate pages. The events page has a panel layout because this saves\n
space. The panels have a button which can expand the details. This places details of the event below\n
the set of 3 panels. I also made a database. This currently stores details about the events, their statistics\n
, etc. It also stores volunteer information, and has a linking table between the events and volunteers; what \n
events did a volunteer take part in. In the final product this could be linked to a page; on the admin page\n
which shows graphs of correlations between statistics. I have demonstrated this in the chartexample.html file.

I see the charts being combined into the admin page and being linked to data coming from the database. The \n
blog page will be able to link to the database on the backend which will be updated; adding posts and testimonials,\n
on the admin page. The events page will also be fully customisable from the admin page; pictures will be changeable, \n
event titles, text, etc.
