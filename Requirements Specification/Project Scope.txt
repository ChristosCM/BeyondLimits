Project Scope


The project involves creating a website for the charity “Beyond Limits”. In this website there will be information about upcoming events, ways for people to get in touch with the client and forms that potential volunteers can fill to express their interest.

The project will deliver a functioning website mainly build with html, css and bootstrap that will have an admin page for the client to manage. The design of the website will revolve around ease of use, so it will consist of simple fields and explanations about each one.
