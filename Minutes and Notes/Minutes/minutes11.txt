Website needs to be finalised by next week so that testing can begins and so that it can be hosted online (most probably on AWS)
Need to email Beyond Limits for a few things (see above) + whatever else we are missing
Send them a link to a stable version of the site before the final product in hopes that we can get some feedback and perfect a few things
