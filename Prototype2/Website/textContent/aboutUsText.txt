<p>Beyond Limits aims to provide a place of peace or retreat to relieve 
anyone in poverty or distress by reason of youth, age, ill-health, 
disability, financial hardship or other disadvantage by providing the 
facilities to allow individuals and families to spend time away from 
home to reconnect with themselves, their families or with others.</p>
<p>We also promote learning through the continued development of 
individual capabilities, competencies, skills and understanding in 
subjects of educational & personal value by providing training and 
development of skills and knowledge to those attending the retreat as a 
result of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or 
other disadvantage allowing them to succeed beyond their limits.</p>
<p>We provide relief of financial hardship by providing such persons 
with goods, which they could not otherwise afford through lack of means.
 We operate with a Christian Ethos.</p>        <div style="text-align: center;"></div>
